_You need to be make a pair with the incoming card._
```
// positive number: 
    odd number with even number
// negative number: 
    odd with odd and even with even
// zero: 
  can be pair with any number, 
  this is a final movement
// "combo": 
  when you pair with the 
  inverse one
```
You can controll this game by click on `left` `right` or `center` side of screen, or use the key: `<`, `space`,  `>`.
The set of card are scrolling left to right and back.
